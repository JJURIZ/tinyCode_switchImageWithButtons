# tinyCode_ImageSwitch
Testing switching images after clicking an HTML tag. 
I was asked to assist with a WordPress project. The designer was attempting to switch overlapping images on button click. 
Before attempting this on WordPress I setup a local environment and setup the desired functionality. 
After the test was successful we implemented the change on the WordPress site (wildcumberland.com).
